- **Pricing Sensitivity** → Small changes in item pricing had a noticeable impact on revenue.

## 💡 Recommendations  
- Focus marketing on **high-margin items**, not just best-sellers.  
- Encourage **digital payments** through promotions, as they correlate with higher spending.  
- Use **seasonal menu adjustments** to align with customer preferences.  
- Test **small price increases** on top sellers to maximize revenue without hurting demand.
